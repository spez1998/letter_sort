# letter_sort
A small program to verify the results of a mathematical probability problem.

> You are in the process of applying to five financial services companies.
> You have written cover letters for each, all of which are clearly marked,
> along with five clearly marked envelopes addressed to each company.
> You have not placed the letters into the envelope because you have gone to greet
> your family who have just arrived for a dinner party. Unfortunately, your young
> nephew manages to get into your study and, in an attempt to help you, decides to
> put each letter inside an envelope. The problem is, he cannot read yet and so
> has placed letters randomly into envelopes.
> What is the probability that every letter has found its way into the incorrect
> envelope?

This problem can, of course, be solved mathematically. We attempted to solve it
and eventually Charlotte managed to find the solution. However, we weren't sure
if this was correct or not, so we decided to find the percentage of every
letter placement being incorrect out of a large number of samples.

This isn't complicated code. We made this in about an hour. I uploaded it to
Github to teach Charlotte the principles of version control. She wrote basically
all the code, and I improved it (improving structure).
